	<p>Portrait of Vincent Nubiola <span>(Catalan: Retrat de Vicenç Nubiola)</span> is an oil painting by Spanish artist Joan Miró. Painted in 1917 when Miró was 24 years old, a year before his first exhibition, the portrait is now considered a masterpiece from a period when he experimented with both Cubism and Fauvism. It is also said by some art critics to show the influence of Van Gogh. Acquired for a time by Picasso, the painting is now in the permanent collection of the Folkwang Museum in Essen (Germany).</p>

	<p>Miró (1893-1983) showed an early passion for art, and attended drawing classes while he was at primary school,[2] but he had been heading for a career in banking when he had a nervous breakdown and decided to study art.[3] He met Vicenç Nubiola whilst studying life art at Barcelona's Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc, a catholic-inspired art society, in 1913.</p>
