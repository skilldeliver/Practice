	Since 2007, Carroll has been a registered actress.[6] In August 2008, when working as a receptionist at a golf club,[2] Carroll was announced as the new Lara Croft model for the latest video game featuring the heroine, Tomb Raider: Underworld. Carroll replaced previous Lara model Karima Adebibe, who retired from the role earlier in the year. Carroll held the position until 2010, and is the final official Lara Croft model, as the use of models has been discontinued for future Tomb Raider games.</p>
